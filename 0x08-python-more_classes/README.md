# More Classes and Objects
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about object oriented programming (OOP), Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, instances and classes attributes in **Python**.

## Technologies
* Python Scripts are written with Python 3.4.3
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

| `3-rectangle.py` | Class `Rectangle` that counts with a string representation |
| `4-rectangle.py` | Class `Rectangle` that count with an official representation |
| `5-rectangle.py` | Class `Rectangle` that prints a message when an instance is deleted |
| `6-rectangle.py` | Class `Rectangle` with a public class attribute that counts the number of instances |
| `7-rectangle.py` | Class `Rectangle` with a public class attribute to print a specific symbol |
